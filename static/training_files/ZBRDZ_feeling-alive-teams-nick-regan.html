  <div><p>I was recently asked ''When do you feel most alive?'' and my answer after some reflection was; ''When I play football (soccer).''  I'm 48 and still playing semi-competitively every Friday evening.&nbsp;Since I was a small kid I have loved it so much; the physical workout, the emotions of competing, focus on winning, drive to never give up when losing, the joy of scoring a goal or making an assist and the team work. I really LOVE the team work, it's the most important part of football, even Messi can't win alone :-)</p><p>So reflecting on this question and my answer, in a business / professional setting I realized how much I love to lead teams, work in and work with teams. </p><p>But how much do I actually 'know' about teams?  I've been playing football for 40 years and working in teams for 30 years, lead them (sometimes successfully) for 15-20 years, and trained team dynamics and behaviors for 7 years.&nbsp; I even set up a business based on 'creative collaboration teams,' surely I must 'know' all that I need to know about teams? &nbsp;Well, apparently not!</p><p>I recently met a new colleague (BIG THANKS @ Mark Edmin) who introduced me to the 6 Team Conditions; the Science and Art of Great Teams. I am blown away! What a fabulous framework to help design, launch and enhance collaboration in great teams!</p><p>Last week I finished the Foundation certificate and yesterday I started the online Advanced practitioner course. Above is a screenshot of the Mural board made up of the trainees choice of ‘introduction to teams’ image. Can you guess which image I chose?</p><p>Really looking forward to 'feeling alive' and learning with the other trainees and 6 Team Conditions faculty in the coming weeks.  Also planning to post some more thoughts on the key learning points as I go through the program... but now it's Friday evening, so time to get ready for a game of football :-)</p><p><br></p></div>
