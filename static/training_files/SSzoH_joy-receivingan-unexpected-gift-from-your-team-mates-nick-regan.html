  <div><p>A couple of weeks ago I received a 10 year visa to stay working here in the Netherlands.&nbsp;PHEW,,, this was quite a relief after some months of uncertainty due to Brexit.</p><p>&nbsp;I was happy to share this good news with family, friends and some of my business clients.&nbsp;I also shared the good news with my Friday evening football buddies…. YES!!&nbsp;Really great to sign up for another 10 years of football together!</p><p>&nbsp;Last Friday I went along to the game and before starting the guys called me and the whole team over to the side of the pitch.&nbsp;They made a team circle, asked me to stand in the middle and said they had a small gift for me as they were really happy that I could stay in NL. &nbsp;They presented me an official 1978 Dutch football shirt!&nbsp;It was completely unexpected and I was completely bowled over / emotional. &nbsp;I mean... an official 1978 Dutch football shirt! … Does a better gift (or football team) even exist..?</p><p>For the last few days and even now writing this, I can still feel the joy.&nbsp;It’s kind of ridiculous ‘for a football shirt’, but I really love football since I was a small child…. &amp; I’m really no expert on how long or deep joy can last in the body,,,,, but this feels like it will stay a whole lot of longer than these few days.</p><p>During the last months I’ve been learning (a lot) about ‘teams’ and ‘team coaching’ in a business environment.&nbsp;I learnt about team effectiveness, team dynamics, team motivation, team leadership, team design, team launches, and systems of teams, etc etc etc,,, there is a lots to learn about teams.</p><p>I also learnt that the best team coaches are truly authentic and bring their whole self and all their past experiences to support their teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore I’m sharing the joy of receiving this ‘unexpected gift’ from my football buddies with my Linkedin Network … in the future I will certainly encourage the teams that I work with and coach to share ‘unexpected gifts’ with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure everybody wants a 1978 Dutch football shirt,,, but choosing the right gift for your team mate and presenting it when they are completely not expecting it, can create a truly deep relationship bond in your team.</p></div>
