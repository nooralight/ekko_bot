  <div><p>It's a lovely quote isn't it.... "Who am I?... I don't know..."  </p><p>Not sure who mused this first, but I'm gonna give a go too... here goes with some musing around stories from each of my decades. </p><p>Who am I?</p><p>When I was 4, a beautiful little bundle called Louise arrived at our door.  My parents seemingly thought 3 kids (aged 6, 4 and 2) was far too easy for their parenting super powers, so they welcomed Louise as a foster child for a few weeks.  She wasn't my first foster sibling but she was the first one who had severe down's syndrome.... She was at this point a few months old and had already been to several 'homes.'  Nobody else wanted this little girl, who would be dependent on her parents for her whole life... but my parents absolutely did!  She quickly became our 'real' sister and 47 years later Louise, the beautiful little package is still with them.</p><p>What an amazing act of kindness by my parents... I could never replicate it.... but sometimes my kids say "Dad, you are kind."  So I suppose I inherited some kindness through nature and learnt a big chunk more when I was 4.  </p><p>Kindness is a part of who I am.</p><p>When I was 16, I passed my school exams in the top 2% of my school year.  I was a bit, ok a lot of a swot..... I worked so hard, every lesson, every homework, every school activity.  If I got less that 8/10 I was disappointed.  Once I got a 5/10 and cried at home,,, even though it was top of the class.  </p><p>Looking back I wish I got more 5's.... that would have been absolutely ok.  In my teenage years I learnt to 'pass' every exam.  Later I learnt that learning is bigger than this... Learn knowledge, learn to apply the knowledge, learn broadly, learn from failure, learn from experiences, learn to reflect, learn with others and learn for joy.</p><p>I love learning it's a part of who I am.</p><p>In my late 20's I was living in Michigan, working as an Engineer in the global auto industry and flying (far too often) around the world.  What a buzz, what an adventure!  I had the idea to have my 29th birthday weekend in New York City, I thought I'd invite a couple of friends along.  On the Friday evening we (the couple of friends, turned out to be about about 30 friends,,, I'm still ashamed of the weekend carbon footprint, but it was the coolest place on earth to party,) drank cocktails at sunset on the top floor of the World Trade Center Twin Towers.  What a weekend, what an experience, what an adventure!!  A year later the Twin Towers were (horrifically) no more. I moved back to Europe for my next adventure.</p><p>Life is a big adventure.  Adventure is a part of me.</p><p>I love art and artists.  My best friend is the British kinetic artist <a target="_blank">Martin Smith</a>.  When I was 36 we went on holiday together with our young families in France and I asked if we could work together... soon after we created <a target="_blank">Laikingland</a> and for the next 10 years or so,,, and still now (but less frequently), we collaborate together and with other artists to craft beautiful kinetic objects.  Our works don't have a conventional function, but they have created so much joy in their conception, development, making, marketing and selling.</p><p>Creativity is joy.  Creativity is also a part of me.</p><p>My 40's were a total train crash... not the whole decade but still.  We have 3 boys and the oldest chose to drive himself off the rails,,, from the age of 13.... tough tough times for us trying to guide him away from criminality... we tried everything that we could but it just wasn't possible to reach him... when he was nearly 16 his crimes were so numerous and serious that he was sentenced to the most severe sentence that the Dutch justice system can give.  I nearly collapsed when he received the verdict, but I lifted myself up, gave him a hug before he was led away.... later I went for a long run in the woods near our home.  During the run I called on my value of 'positivity, to help me keep going.</p><p>The next day I visited him in the youth detention center and he told me, ''Let's be positive Dad, maybe this is what I needed''.</p><p>Positivity is part of me.  Now I see that this sentence is what he needed... in our family therapy sessions, the boys often say "Positivity is part of you Dad."</p><p>Now I'm 51.... and I LOVE IT!!!  The train is back on the tracks... Life is good.</p><p>I'm living and working with the wonderfully amazing <a target="_blank">Elsa Regan-Klapisz, PhD</a> in the field of Coaching and Team Coaching.  I believe these stories and many more have led me here and here I lean on and am guided by my values of kindness, learning, adventure, creativity and positivity.  They are parts of me.  They are parts of ''Who am I?''</p><p>In my next decade (probably more) I'm so very interested in creating stories about ''Who are you?''  You as a person.  You as a team... Wow, this resonates for me!! </p><p>It's such a beautiful musing for both individuals and teams.  These musings are about life and life is about living your (core) values.... my intention is to build more stories based on my one last but not least core value.... Camaraderie. </p><p>Camaraderie is a part of me.  Let's lean on it to discover 'who are you?'        </p><p><strong>#values</strong> <strong>#life</strong> <strong>#kindness</strong> <strong>#learning</strong> <strong>#adventure</strong> <strong>#creativity</strong> <strong>#positivity</strong> <strong>#camaraderie</strong> <strong>#coaching</strong> <strong>#teamcoaching</strong> <strong>#teams</strong>      </p></div>
