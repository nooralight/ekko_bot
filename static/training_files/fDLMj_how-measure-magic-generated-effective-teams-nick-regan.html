  <div><p>I recently wrote a short article about how much I had learnt when performing a 15 minute team coaching task.&nbsp; Now, I will offer a similarly short article. with some reflections on things I learnt when working in Project Engineering teams in the global automotive industry, over a period of 15 years.</p><p>My reflections will focus on ‘team effectiveness’. &nbsp;Until recently, I really didn’t know that there was so much I didn’t know about ‘team effectiveness’.&nbsp; But then I bumped into the research work of Richard Hackman, Ruth Wageman and Erin Lehman and their seminal publication Team Diagnostic Survey, first published in the journal of behavioral science (Dec 2005).</p><p>Here goes:</p><p>As an individual, I’m very objective and goal driven. &nbsp;I like nothing more than finding / creating solutions to complex, tricky problems.&nbsp; Problems that often involve both ‘people things’ and ‘thing things’ and yes, the ‘people things’ are usually the more complex part of the problems.</p><p>Anyway, I can usually cobble together some sort of ‘solution,’ deliver it in an appropriate time frame with an appropriate budget, and so I concluded; ‘I’m effective’.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the legendary Peter Drucker seemed to agree, “Effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by <u>results</u> not attributes.”</p><p>It’s good, safe ground to be on the same page as Peter Drucker!</p><p>Translating this to the scope of teams, it seems Mr Drucker continued to agree. &nbsp;''The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say ‘I’.  And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say ‘I’.  They don't think ‘I’.  They think ‘we’; they think ‘team’. They understand their job to be to make the team function.  They accept responsibility and don't sidestep it, but ‘we’ gets the credit.  This is what creates trust, what enables you to <u>get the task done</u>.’’</p><p>I love working in teams, ‘we’ <u>get the task done</u>.&nbsp; When ‘we’ do this, we are an effective team…. Right?</p><p>Well, as it turns out this is partly right.</p><p>According to the fabulous research of Hackman, Wageman and Lehman, there is more to it that ‘just’ delivering results or getting the task done.&nbsp; There are in fact are 3 items (and some nuance) that are needed to be considered an effective team:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver results (Well done Nick &amp; Peter!): but with the nuance that the results should ‘exceed’ the expectations of the customer.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously improve team performance; the team becomes an increasingly capable performing unit over time.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn / develop each of the team members; &nbsp;Members personal learning and growth are fostered by their experiences in the team.</p><p>Obviously I’m only one humble data point to the researchers, but reflection is a good way to learn so I’d like to offer some reflection on these findings.&nbsp;  Here goes with my personal experiences of delivering projects with Engineering teams in the global automotive industry.</p><p>Firstly, the nuance that to be an effective team, the delivered project ‘results’ need to exceed the expectations of the customers.</p><p>I worked half of my career engineering in 1st tier automotive project teams, developing complex sub systems and parts for the global automotive OEM companies. &nbsp;Meeting their expectations, let alone exceeding them was tough!&nbsp; Looking back at some of our best project teams, we managed to deliver good projects / products by having a real collaborative relationship with the customer and a real ‘Voice of the customer’ feeling inside the team.&nbsp; When making big decisions we would always considered the effect on the customer and end user.&nbsp; Ultimately this lead not only to high quality / reliable products on the customer vehicles, but also high quality / low scrap production processes in our assembly plants.&nbsp; We had a real focus on the basic Lean principle of creating value for the customer.</p><p>Conversely on a 'less good project', we had much less understanding and empathy for our OEM customers and certainly less of a click with them in terms of collaboration.&nbsp; The weak relationship led to lack of trust which in turn led to an increase in requests for information and data and visits to customer sites and general ‘waste’.&nbsp; In the end this spiraled towards a project that ‘got the task done’ but the product wasn’t the best in terms of quality, cost and timing.</p><p>Secondly, let’s reflect on the need of effective teams to continuously improve team performance i.e. become an increasingly capable performing unit over time.</p><p>I remember working as an Engineering Manager with a cross functional team developing a product for another OEM customer.&nbsp; We had a good understanding and relationship with the client team, but our team were becoming frustrated.&nbsp; The customer was very inclusive in their decision making process and would seemingly take ‘forever’ to make decisions.&nbsp; I’ll never forget the phase their team manager often used; ‘’We don’t have the time, but we should take the time’’.&nbsp;What a gem!</p><p>In terms of reducing the frustration in the team and speeding up the decision making process, we decided to set up a steering committee that included the senior team members of both our company and the OEM customer.&nbsp; The steering committee was a small team of 5 people within the larger project team.&nbsp; In the steering committee we didn’t make big decisions for the team, but were able to simply prioritize the main project issues and this allowed the broader team to focus and make the decisions they needed to make.&nbsp;It was a fine example of simply tweaking the work process to create a major impact on the collective team performance.</p><p>Thirdly, some thoughts on effective teams that foster members personal learning and growth by their experiences in the team.</p><p>Looking back on the previous mentioned ‘less good project’, I’m happy to reflect that the team of individuals really learnt and developed through this difficult project.&nbsp;After this particular project many of the engineers moved on to other projects with other customers and delivered some great products!&nbsp;Many of the engineers from the team are still in my network and have developed into very senior roles across different companies and industries.&nbsp; I think this ‘less good project’ was a great learning point for all of us.&nbsp; Sometimes I look back and wonder at the great resilience this team showed and the drive and creativity they exhibited when facing the many issues that we faced during that time.</p><p>In conclusion, I find these reflections really motivating with the main take away that team effectiveness is not as one dimensional, as I had previously thought.&nbsp; Tough projects with results that do not exceed customer expectations may be a spring board for great individual learning and development.&nbsp;And tweaks to improve the group performance can have great impact on the results that can be delivered to customers.</p><p>To finish this article, I'll use a couple more quotes.&nbsp; First from Richard Hackman:</p><p>“I have no question that when you have a&nbsp;<strong>team</strong>, the possibility exists that it will <strong>generate&nbsp;magic</strong>, producing something extraordinary…but don't count on it.” &nbsp;</p><p>In fact the teams magic needs to be measured using the results as seen by the customer, the continuous improvement of the team and the individual learning on the team members.</p><p>And finally back to Peter Drucker:</p><p>‘’Teamwork is neither ‘good’ nor ‘desirable’. It is a fact. Wherever people work together or play together they do so as a team. Which team to use for what purpose is a crucial, difficult and risky decision that is even harder to unmake. Managements have yet to learn how to make it.’’</p><p>Well now, lucky for us all, the research is available to help ‘Managements’ learn how to make these ‘team’ decisions.&nbsp;And even luckier, the Team Diagnostic Survey research is commercially available (since 2017) to help them design, launch and coach their teams.&nbsp;</p><p>So going forwards, I’m hoping this research is applied across many organisations.  It will not only develop effective teams, but also to give teams a chance of generating magic!</p></div>
