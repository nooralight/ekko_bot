  <div><p>I have a strong preference to learning in an individual setting, by myself.&nbsp;It’s really a safe place.&nbsp;It’s comfortable, I can learn at my own pace and set myself targets and ‘grade’ myself as pass or fail.&nbsp;I can soak up tonnes of knowledge, try out new skills, reflect and improve them.&nbsp;I love reading books and articles, listening to podcasts, watching presentations and lectures, making notes and dreaming up ideas of my own as I go.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of ideas, I love to sit in my home office (quite a handy trait in the last few months) to create and design training material and exercises from which others can learn.&nbsp;Due to my years of experience in the corporate world, I can imagine the business setting of my target group and empathize with their learning needs.&nbsp;It’s a real joy to design learning interventions that will help people grow.&nbsp;And joy is not the only positive emotion that I experience, there’s also wonder and drive and feeling competent and calm.&nbsp;It’s great, I’m really a lucky guy to be able to work and learn this way.</p><p>But is it enough?&nbsp;Well sometimes, yes, it’s absolutely enough.&nbsp;I do need time to enjoy some learning (and work) by myself.</p><p>But sometimes it’s also definitely not enough.&nbsp;It’s too safe and too comfortable.&nbsp;There’s not enough challenge and not enough BUZZ of learning from said challenge.&nbsp;And there is zero fear, which appears at first glance to be ok, but looking more towards its basic level, fear can be quite a motivator to meeting the challenge.</p><p>Yesterday I had a nice challenge!</p><p>I was asked to coach a team activity though the following question, ‘Do we need to a Real Team?’&nbsp;</p><p>Normally this wouldn’t be that much of a challenge, I’ve facilitated lots of face to face, team effectiveness workshops, and led many online team meetings.&nbsp;But this team activity was different, I was ‘coaching’ a team and at the same time transitioning the discussions between Zoom and Mural.&nbsp;My home office had, all of a sudden, lost it feeling of comfort.</p><p>So how did it go….</p><p>Firstly the good news, I survived!</p><p>Second the really good news, here’s a list of the things I learnt:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When preparing for online team activities : keep it very simple.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design with others if possible, it’s great to discuss &amp; swap ideas… (my design buddies Michelle and Amanda are GREAT!)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the team are comfortable with the technology (Mural is easy but takes a little guidance to get going.)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the Mural board to make it as easy as possible for the team to work on their task.&nbsp;(See above image.)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask yourself; what answers are you expecting from the group?&nbsp;(It’s standard training design practice but even more valuable for virtual sessions.)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t fall into teacher / student or one to one discussions.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t take too much on your own shoulders.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say ‘exactly’ what the team should do for the activity.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do frame the exercise for context,,,, but not for too long.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct questions to the whole team, let the team discuss and do the work… fade to the background.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuff bubbles up when a team is working, decide what to do with it.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe which emotions you feel in the group?&nbsp;And let them know if it seems important.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow is fast… let the team take their time.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the team challenging questions e.g. Does the team need to exist?</p><p>Thirdly, (via zoom chat) I got some positive feedback, ‘’Well done!&nbsp;Really well facilitated Nick.’’</p><p>Wow it was quite an experience…&nbsp;And now for my admission.</p><p>The activity was actually part of a course I am following to become a trainer / coach for ‘6 Team Conditions’.&nbsp;The 'team' was a group of my fellow trainees playing roles of a case study and the activity only took 15 (FIFTEEN) minutes.&nbsp;Maybe our design was a bit too ambitious to fit into this time-frame... But isn't it amazing what you can learn in 15 minutes!</p><p>Reflecting back on the activity as I write. I can still feel the BUZZ of the challenge.&nbsp;It was uncomfortable but motivating.&nbsp;A motivation to start putting this new knowledge and skills into practice with some of my clients.&nbsp;Let’s see if they too can dive into uncomfortable spaces, quickly realize these can also be safe places to learn together, grow together and also feel the BUZZ of overcoming the challenges they face.</p></div>
