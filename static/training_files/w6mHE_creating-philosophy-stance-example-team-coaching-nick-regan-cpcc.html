  <div><p>I recently completed a 9 month training program at <a target="_blank">Team Coaching Studio</a> to further develop my competences as a Team Coach.  I've been working on Team development in the corporate environment since 2017 and my work has mostly been 'facilitation' of team workshops.  From the program I was seeking some guidance and practice to shift towards 'team coaching', as a complimentary skill set to 'facilitation'.  To be clear; when 'working to grow / develop teams', sometimes 'coaching' is beneficial and sometimes 'facilitation' is more appropriate, choosing which depends on the situation and needs of the team.</p><p>'Team coaching' is a fascinating and still a budding profession and I chose this  program as the 'competence content' is aligned with the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/credentials-and-standards/team-coaching/competencies" target="_blank">ICF team coaching competences</a>, that were published for the first time in 2022.  </p><p>Here are some of the 'Team Coaching' competences that we learnt:</p><p>Ethical Practice &amp; Contracting</p><p>Effective Relating / Psychological Safety &amp; Trust</p><p>Direct Communication / Powerful Questions / Active Listening</p><p>Relationship Systems / Wider Context &amp; Stakeholders / Power &amp; Authority</p><p>Creating Awareness / Generating Results</p><p>See image below for the <strong>TCS Team Coaching Competence Wheel </strong>around which you can read these competences.</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQEelbmVt7DFCQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQEelbmVt7DFCQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1693399030428?e=1725494400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=JGf7WHG9BFIIUokthbyeB04h5kHq5R-dwPwoMSO9psg"><figcaption>TCS Team Coaching Competency Wheel : Created by </figcaption></figure><p>All of the above competences are so very valuable for a Team Coach to bring to the team with whom he / she is working, but as I progressed through the program I came to realize that the center of the Wheel was really the most valuable / crucial component to 'Being a Team Coach'?</p><p>At the center of the wheel is a Team Coaches 'philosophy and stance'.  The philosophy is basically the 'beliefs / principles that guide us' as a team coach.  The stance is 'what do we stand for?'</p><p>Throughout the program we crafted and sensed and re-crafted our personal philosophy and stance... it was quite a struggle (I never had a 'philosophy' before'..)  But in the end it was so worth it and I have leaned on both of these during each and every team session that I have been in since.  </p><p><strong>Here is my philosophy :</strong></p><p>I became a team coach because <strong>I believe in the ‘’power of teams’’</strong>… the power of a team to create impact.&nbsp; I have worked with individuals and I have worked across whole organizations.&nbsp; I believe that teams have the power to create impact for the individuals, with other teams, in the organization and more broadly in the system.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, on a sports field teams can create impact.&nbsp; Even if they don’t ‘win’, their impact can be felt.&nbsp; See the above image of the Dutch 1974 world cup soccer team.  They actually came 2nd, but they created ‘the beautiful game’ which was a style of ‘playing’ that is still influencing the way soccer is played nearly 50 years later.</p><p>I became a team coach because <strong>I believe in ‘’togetherness’’</strong>.&nbsp; Throughout my life I have been attracted to the camaraderie of being with other humans and collaborating together to achieve something that we are passionate about.</p><p>I became a team coach because <strong>I believe in ‘’learning’’</strong>.&nbsp; I am from a family absolutely full of teachers,,, I never wanted to be a teacher but ‘learning’ is in my blood.&nbsp; I believe that teams are a perfect arena in which to learn… where team members can both leverage and apply their strengths and also dive into their learning edges in a ‘safe’ environment.&nbsp; Teams are also &nbsp;the perfect arena in which to experiment.</p><p>I became a team coach because <strong>I believe in ‘’Team creativity’’</strong>.&nbsp; For me, creativity is joy!&nbsp; Creativity is the art of enabling something new / original and valuable to emerge.&nbsp; When teams give themselves the permission and space / time to dive into creativity, then magic can happen.&nbsp; Without creativity there is no innovation…. If I can help teams to be creative and embrace possibilities, I feel alive.</p><p><strong>And here is my stance:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Meet the team where they are.</p></li><li><p>Trust the WE and empower the team.</p></li><li><p>Be calm, this creates space for the team.</p></li><li><p>Slow down and focus on the figure that emerges.</p></li><li><p>Listen and act with kindness.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the positive and on the team strengths.</p></li><li><p>Have the knowledge available / hold frameworks and models lightly in my pocket.</p></li><li><p>Challenge the team to grow and become more effective.</p></li><li><p>Get the team out of their ‘heads’ … Embrace possibilities.</p></li></ul><p><strong>A Broader Reflection on Philosophy and Stance.</strong></p><p>I've written this article about my philosophy and stance as a 'Team Coach', it confirms what I believe in and what I stand for as a 'Team Coach',,, it gives me guidance and something to lean on as I work, it's relevant in all aspect of my role.  I can imagine it's also relevant for current and future clients to understand who I am / who they are working with. </p><p>More broadly, I can imagine that any professional, in any role,,, with any wheel of competences, could potentially have a philosophy and stance at the center of their wheel....!  Why not?</p><p>An engineer, a lawyer, a team leader, a CEO, a sales person etc...  You probably already have a list (or wheel) of competences,,,, If you don't have a philosophy and stance, at the middle of your wheel, to guide you and lean on.... Why not start crafting one?</p><p>p.s. Sending BIG appreciation to <a target="_blank">Georgina Woudstra, MCC, ACTC</a> and <a target="_blank">Allard de Jong (MA, PCC, ACTC)</a> for all your expertise, wisdom and guidance during the program.</p><p></p><p></p><p>   </p></div>
