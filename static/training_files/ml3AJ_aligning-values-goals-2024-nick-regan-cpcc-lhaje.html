  <div><p>One of my ‚Äò‚Äôgo to‚Äô‚Äô 1:1 coaching techniques is to ask my coachee to visualize the future and describe a party that they will offer in 10 ‚Äì 15 years where their invitees are the people that really mean something to them, people that they love.</p><p>During the visualization we imagine the invitees approaching the coachee 1 by 1 or in small groups and taking a moment to express their gratitude for the impact the coachee has made on their lives ‚Äî often they share a special story or two from each of their invitees.&nbsp; I listen in and ask questions to uncover a list of ‚Äòvalues‚Äô that run through the stories.</p><p>After the visualization I share this list of values that I‚Äôve captured and ask the coachee, ‚Äò‚ÄôWhich of these values really resonate with you‚Äô‚Äô‚Ä¶. There are normally 5 or 6 values from the list that can be used by the coachee as their CORE VALUES!!</p><p>Before experiencing this visualization and training as a coach I thought‚Ä¶. So what, big deal, then a person has a list of core values. &nbsp;</p><p>But later after experiencing the visualization myself and with many clients and by diving deeper into each one of the specific core values to fully understand them, I realized that each person has a different perspective of a value e.g. Freedom for one person may be ‚ÄúFreedom is about being able to choose how I want to live my life ‚Äì and being able to change my mind and choose a different path.‚Äô‚Äô&nbsp; And for another ‚ÄúFreedom is about being able to express my ideas and emotions openly.‚Äù&nbsp; Creating this personal definition gives us real ownership of each Core Value and also helps to make them actionable.</p><p>After defining each Core Value I then invite my coachee to <em>make them actionable</em>, with this sentence:</p><p>‚Äò‚ÄôIf values are about ‚Ä¶ Filling your day with things you value!&nbsp; How do you want to bring your Core Values into each and every day?‚Äù</p><p>Now at the start of 2024, I‚Äôm stepping it up a level, I‚Äôm planning to fill my year with things I value by setting myself some goals (for the year) aligned to each of my Core Values.&nbsp;</p><p>Here goes:</p><p><em>Kindness</em></p><p>Definition: Being friendly, generous and considerate to myself and others.</p><p>Goal:&nbsp; I will bring ‚ÄòKindness‚Äô to all my 1:1 coachees / clients, a minimum of 20 coachees.</p><p><em>Positivity</em></p><p>Definition: Embracing the negative and staying positive.</p><p>Goal: I will bring ‚ÄòPositivity‚Äô to my Team Coaching clients with a minimum of 8 team development journeys.</p><p><em>Learning</em></p><p>Definition:&nbsp; Gain Knowledge and understanding, apply, reflect, experiment, teach / train and always improve.</p><p>Goal: I will become a Certified dialogue practitioner by following the <a href="https://www.dialogue-associates.com/a-different-way-of-working" target="_blank">Association of Dialogue practitioners</a> 6 month training program.</p><p><em>Creativity</em></p><p>Definition: Be Creative, put new ‚Äòstuff‚Äô out there, allow ‚ÄòMagic‚Äô to happen.</p><p>Goal: I will co-create&nbsp;and publish a book for teams of the present and the future.</p><p><em>Adventure</em></p><p>Definition: Seek and experience everyday adventures big and small.</p><p>Goal: I will facilitate a minimum of 4 Leadership retreats in nature by launching <a href="http://www.GatheringNatuurlijk.nl" target="_blank">www.GatheringNatuurlijk.nl</a></p><p><em>Camaraderie</em></p><p>Definition: Be fully human together and share joyful adventures.</p><p>Goal:&nbsp; See above goals üòä‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs go 2024!!&nbsp; <a target="_blank">Elsa Regan-Klapisz, PhD</a> , <a target="_blank">Barnab√© Regan</a> , <a target="_blank">Maha Alusi</a> , <a target="_blank">Henrik Herrmann</a> , <a target="_blank">Pierre Fel</a> , <a target="_blank">Floris Dekker</a> !</p><p></p><p>Ohhhh‚Ä¶ And one additional <em>Camaraderie</em> goal to support all of the above ‚Ä¶</p><p>I‚Äôm planning to run the Amsterdam marathon in October.&nbsp; (The image is at the end of my first 5KM training run in the French countryside‚Ä¶&nbsp; Let‚Äôs GO <a target="_blank">Barnab√© Regan</a> !)</p><p>I‚Äôm wondering how aligned are your values and your goals for this year?&nbsp; If you‚Äôre curious to dive into this question together please feel free to contact me. üòä</p></div>
