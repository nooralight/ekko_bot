  <div><p>Just over a year ago, we (Nick and Floris) two friends from Utrecht, went for a walk in the Dutch countryside.&nbsp; We discussed our common passions of connecting people together, learning, adventures, and the outdoors and we conceived a plan for what we call ‘Gathering Natuurlijk’.&nbsp; Nick is English (Gathering), and Floris is Dutch (Natuurlijk). Gathering is about bringing people together with a purpose and ‘Natuurlijk’ not only means ‘from nature’ but also ‘naturally’ and that resonates with us.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Gathering Natuurlijk‘ is our retreat in nature for Leaders who are open to reconnecting with themselves and learning with others.</p><p>We immediately dived into action and planned the first ‘Gathering’. We created a program, put together a brochure, and sent it out into the ‘world’. &nbsp;We received many positive and interested responses, but unfortunately, the date didn’t fit in everyone’s agenda.&nbsp; :-/&nbsp;</p><p>We however, did take our scheduled time in nature, where we spent a delightful day and night with walks and campfire conversations.&nbsp; We further developed our concept and returned refreshed, with new insights, nourished by the green surroundings and whistling birds.</p><p>We realized that in shaping and actioning our first plan, we had done exactly what we want to caution today's leaders against. &nbsp;In the midst of a busy schedule with so many priorities demanding your attention, why do we think we should dive into something new and quickly focus on implementation!&nbsp; This often happens, it happened with us and it happens to leaders in organizations. &nbsp;Those moments when you're typing the latest set of ‘operational’ priorities to your team late at night, because you didn't have the time to write earlier.&nbsp; And a day later, you look at it and think, holy moly,,, what was I thinking?</p><p>We still believe in our ‘Gathering Natuurlijk’ offering. So, we decided to take a step back. We decided to pause, explore our goals and core values more thoroughly. We engaged in conversations with each other and we found the connection of why this is so important to us and why we find it crucial for leaders. We sought and received expert help for our branding communication.&nbsp; Step by step it became more clear. By slowing down, listening to each other and ourselves, asking for help, and taking the time, we have come much further than a year ago.&nbsp;And now here we are….</p><p>We are launching our new website with our plans for 2024.&nbsp; (See comments for the link!)</p><p>We have set four dates in 2024 :</p><p>21 March / 18 April / 11 June / 24 Sept</p><p>And each separate date will have a chosen ‘leadership’ theme. E.g. &nbsp;&nbsp;Leading both strategically &amp; operationally / Engaging with key stakeholders when making decisions / Team development, people development and ownership.</p><p>We are ready to go….&nbsp;</p><p>But in this adventure, we are not yet there. &nbsp;In every great story, there is a final ‘battle’ before the ’happy ending.’</p><p>We fought our ‘battle’ of not wanting to rush, giving ourselves ‘time’, realizing that when setting off on an adventure it is good to take it step by step.&nbsp;</p><p>Our ‘battle’ was one of ’time’. &nbsp;We knew somewhere that we needed ‘time’, but in our minds, we didn't have ‘time’. We were hostages to our ambition and busy schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>The ‘battle’ in this story is not yet won!&nbsp; ‘Time’ is evidently the ‘battle’ of our ‘Time’.&nbsp; We all feel this each day.</p><p>‘Time’ is a ‘battle’ that you (leaders) must overcome. We are convinced that deep inside you, there is a little voice saying, ‘it would be very good for me’ to gather in nature with like-minded leaders for a day.&nbsp; That you feel the need to slow down, be calm and learn with others in the outdoors. &nbsp;</p><p>Listen to that voice! You do have the ‘time’. But it's a matter of organizing that ‘time’ differently. Win your battle and sign up.</p><p>Please take a look at our website for more details or get in touch with us in the comments or via email.</p><p>You are warm heartedly welcome to ‘Gathering Natuurljk’.</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you and being with you in nature!&nbsp;</p><p>Cheers / Groetjes!&nbsp; Nick &amp; Floris</p></div>
