  <div><p>I want to capture some reflections about Creativity and here on Linkedin is as good a place as any.  It's a topic close to my heart and a topic becoming more and more relevant and valuable in our complex world.  </p><p>Here goes... </p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celebrating Creativityâ€¦ itâ€™s on the list!</strong></p><p>In the last couple of weeks I saw a report by the World Economic (WEF) on the Future of Jobs which included a list of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/future-of-jobs-2023-skills?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social_scheduler&amp;utm_term=GROWTH2023&amp;utm_content=02%2F05%2F2023+18%3A30" target="_blank">Top 10 skills for 2023</a>.  The report is an impressive and important document and this headline in particular jumped out at meâ€¦.&nbsp;</p><p>â€˜â€™Analytical thinking and <strong>Creative thinking</strong> remain the most important skills for workers in 2023.â€™â€™&nbsp;</p><p>I think, feel and sense that this is a reason to rejoiceâ€¦. </p><p>See above image,,, these Fingers by <a target="_blank">Nik Ramage</a> for <a target="_blank">Laikingland</a> have been tapping a long time, waiting for â€˜Creativityâ€™ to get itâ€™s rightful place in the spot light.&nbsp;Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3qVvb6TYuU" target="_blank">movie</a> of them really tappingâ€¦ ðŸ˜Š </p><p>Many years ago I was educated &amp; trained as an Engineer, so can do the Analytical thinking stuff (No 1 on the list) â€¦ but more importantly, I also learned and love the â€˜Creativityâ€™ stuff.  So I'm really energized that business leaders are now recognizing the value of Creativity.&nbsp;There is clearly a real need for individuals and teams to learn and upskill our Creative Thinking!</p><p>Looking a bit closer at the list, I am a bit disappointed that this â€˜skillâ€™ is called â€˜Creative Thinkingâ€™ and is categorized as a 'Cognitive skill'.&nbsp;Of course, when being Creative we need Cognitive Creative Thinking ,,,, but we also need so much more!!</p><figure class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4E12AQGhMdpOPiO7JA" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQGhMdpOPiO7JA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1683792267115?e=1725494400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=6YDf-v7h2a-lNtd1XR7w9sAXiKkGfnV3ao3f4tQ2eoI"></figure><p>More encouragingly, is that many of the â€˜so much moreâ€™ (skills) also appear in the Top 10 skills list.&nbsp;For example, for Creativity we need, No.3 Resilience, Flexibility, Agility and No.4 Motivation and Self Awareness and No.5 Curiosity and (Life Long Learning),,,, I could go on, in fact for Creativity, the whole Top 10 list would be pretty handy skills to have to upskill our Creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>So with that stated how can we approach / use this list to learn / upskill our Creativity? </p><p>I have no idea how the survey was constructed to segmentize / individualize these skills.... I don't want to dive into all the definitions but I can image quite some cross over between many of them.  And in terms of learning / upskilling, maybe these cross over areas are the most exciting areas to explore. i.e. Don't learn to be a Creative Thinker OR learn Empathy OR learn Reslience, but do learn Creative Thinking AND Empathy AND Reslience AND â€¦. </p><p>AND.... this AND / AND perspective can also be such a fun way of learning and upskillingâ€¦. if approached in an Experimental way.  Especially as we know the complexity of the issues we currently face on a day to day basis, need us to approach them in an Experimental way.&nbsp;In fact maybe due to this complexity, we can upskill by running a series of (everyday) experiments from which to learn and respond... and upskill.</p><p>I think in fact that maybe 'experimenting' is the most wonderful and valuable way to Learn / Upskill our Creativity.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some experiments and reflections on Creativity from my Career / Learning journey.</strong></p><p>Here are some â€˜experimentsâ€™ and â€˜reflectionsâ€™ from my career on How to Learn / Upskill in Creativity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Long before being a coach and team coach, I was educated then worked as a Mechanical Engineerâ€¦. I chose this early Engineering career path because I had a real passion for the making products / designs and also the science to understand how the designs would function in the world and to actually run experiments to learn &amp; eventually prove they would work.</p><p>My reflections : to enhance your creativity, make stuff / get your hands dirty / take part when creating AND be there to understand and learn from the results of your experiments.</p><p>As I transitioned my career from Engineer, to Engineering Manager, I became more interested in the development / growth of humans than the development of technical products.&nbsp;I was intrigued about empowering my team and seeing them create wonderful solutions to the many issues / problems that needed solving.&nbsp;I was always struck that good management / leadership can be learnt in the latest Harvard publications and then practiced as a type of art in creating the relationships and dynamics to enable growth in the team and still deliver results.</p><p>My reflections : To enhance team creativity, empowering Leadership leads to self-motivated team members and allowing team members to experiment creatively (and sometimes fail / learn) leads to an increase in individual and collective creativity.</p><p>Later, I had the opportunity to set up a global Learning and Development team.&nbsp;The organization didnâ€™t have one at the time,,, What a joy to create something new!&nbsp; At the time the world was full of Training Departments, so we also needed to create a shift in the focus from â€œTrainingâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€™Learningâ€™â€™. We assembled a diverse team with wonderful connections and expertise from across the business and dived into many â€˜scientifically provenâ€™ / innovative solutions to help our organization to â€˜â€™Learnâ€™â€™.</p><p>My reflection : &nbsp;Embrace your experts / expertise and your diversity when upskilling on Creativity.</p><p>Alongside these â€˜normalâ€™ career steps I was also thirsty for more creativity and experimentation, so asked my best friend, the British kinetic artist <a target="_blank">Martin Smith</a> if heâ€™d like to work together.&nbsp;We set up a Creative Collaboration business called Laikingland, to craft and design beautiful kinetic sculptures.&nbsp;What a joy to bring his art and craft world together with my engineering (science) and business worldâ€¦ such diversity bought so many creative ideas, products and adventures.&nbsp;In the following 10 years we created wonderful art works, collaborated with other world class artists and delivered our works to many of the best design stores in the world.</p><p>My reflections : &nbsp;Creativity is enhanced when we collaborate with people we trust and care for, with diverse &amp; complimentary skills AND with similar passions.</p><p>In the last few years I shifted my focus again and decided to dive into coaching and team coaching.&nbsp;Iâ€™m drawn still further into psychology and neuro-science of human behaviors and the science of team structures and dynamics in our amazingly complex inter connected world.&nbsp;What a buzz to be learning and practicing my coaching skills with both individuals and teamsâ€¦. In every session with my clients I hold the science and management frameworks / models lightly in my back pocket and try to be curious about the client, to see what change we can create together through our coaching relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My reflections :&nbsp;Everybody and every team can be creative.&nbsp;Being curious and trusting in relationship(s) will enhance creativity.</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Scienceâ€¦on Creativity and Team Creativity.</strong></p><p>Hope you enjoyed my above personal learnings / reflections on my experiments of Upskilling my Creativity.&nbsp;Hope they can be useful examples for you even though from a scientific point of view Iâ€™m just one data pointâ€¦. </p><p>With this in mind I recently (completely) geeked out and read a bunch of scientific research papers on Creativity and Team Creativityâ€¦ here are some of my take awaysâ€¦. </p><p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letâ€™s start with a definitionâ€¦&nbsp;Creativity requires both â€˜originality and effectiveness/value.â€™&nbsp;Both of which for numerous reasons are tricky to judge / measure. </p><p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isnâ€™t yet a perfect â€˜provenâ€™ check list to upskill Team creativity.&nbsp;It can be influenced by the creative process, the creativity, intrinsic motivation and expertise of the individuals involved, the role of leadership, the organisational culture, social dynamics (psychological safety &amp; trust), a supportive environment (communication, experimentation, diversity,) team dynamics, team structure, and the availability of â€˜creativityâ€™ training etcâ€¦. I could go on, but thatâ€™s quite a list already.</p><p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teams are sometimes but not always more creative than individualsâ€¦ e.g. simple brainstorming in a team setting often doesnâ€™t necessarily create more or â€˜betterâ€™ results.</p><p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without creativity, there is no innovation.&nbsp;Creativity is about generating (new and valuable) ideas â€¦ innovation requires the ideas to be implemented.</p><p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the research articles have a section called â€˜limitations of the researchâ€™â€¦. </p><p>These research findings (the Science) are fascinating and can be so very valuableâ€¦ if we hold them lightlyâ€¦. See point E above!</p><p>But there is one research finding that I have learnt to embrace fully / totally embrace and encourage you to also when upskilling your Creativity.</p><p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although creativity can just happen, itâ€™s important to be intentionally creative.&nbsp;Practicing creativity breeds creativity.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary </strong></p><p>Creativity is becoming more and more important in our complex world.</p><p>Everyone and every team can be creative... &nbsp;Embrace Creativity, Practice it.&nbsp;Run Experiments. Reflect &amp; Learnâ€¦. Repeat to Upskill.</p></div>
